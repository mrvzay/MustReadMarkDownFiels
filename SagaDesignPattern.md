# **Saga Design Pattern - Brief Overview**

## **🔹 What is the Saga Pattern?**
The **Saga Pattern** is a **distributed transaction management strategy** used in microservices architectures where a single business transaction spans multiple services. Instead of using traditional ACID transactions (which don't scale well in distributed systems), it breaks transactions into a sequence of **local transactions** with **compensating actions** for rollback.

### **When to Use It?**
✅ **Long-running transactions** (e.g., e-commerce order processing).  
✅ **Microservices** where each service has its own database.  
✅ **Eventual consistency** is acceptable (no strong consistency).  

---

## **🔹 How Does It Work?**
A Saga consists of a sequence of **local transactions**, each executed in a separate service. If any step fails, **compensating transactions** undo previous steps.

### **Two Implementation Approaches:**
1. **Choreography-Based Saga** (Decentralized)  
   - Services emit **events** to trigger the next step.  
   - Example:  
     - `OrderService` → `OrderCreated` → `PaymentService` → `PaymentProcessed` → `InventoryService`  
     - If `InventoryService` fails, it emits `InventoryFailed` → `PaymentService` refunds.  

2. **Orchestration-Based Saga** (Centralized)  
   - A **Saga Orchestrator** (central coordinator) manages the flow.  
   - Example:  
     - `SagaOrchestrator` → `OrderService` → `PaymentService` → `InventoryService`  
     - If `InventoryService` fails, the orchestrator triggers compensating actions.  

---

## **🔹 Example: E-Commerce Order Saga**
### **1. Successful Flow**
1. **Order Service**: Creates an order (PENDING).  
2. **Payment Service**: Charges the customer.  
3. **Inventory Service**: Reserves items.  
4. **Order Service**: Confirms order (COMPLETED).  

### **2. Failed Flow (Compensation)**
1. **Order Service**: Creates order (PENDING).  
2. **Payment Service**: Charges the customer.  
3. **Inventory Service**: Fails (out of stock).  
4. **Compensation**:  
   - `PaymentService` → **Refund**.  
   - `OrderService` → **Cancel order (FAILED)**.

## **🔹 Pros & Cons**
| **Pros** | **Cons** |
|----------|----------|
| ✅ Works in distributed systems | ❌ Complex to implement |
| ✅ No distributed locks | ❌ Debugging is harder |
| ✅ Scalable | ❌ Eventual consistency (not immediate) |

---

## **🔹 Key Frameworks/Tools**
- **Event-Driven:** Kafka, RabbitMQ (for Choreography).  
- **Orchestration:**  
  - **Temporal.io** (Workflow engine).  
  - **Camunda** (BPMN-based orchestration).  
  - **Custom** (Spring State Machine).  

---

## **🔹 When NOT to Use Sagas?**
❌ If you need **strong consistency** (use 2PC instead).  
❌ For very short-lived transactions (overkill).  

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- **Use Choreography** for **decoupled** systems.  
- **Use Orchestration** for **complex workflows**.  
- **Always implement idempotency** (retries should not cause side effects).

Certainly! The **Saga Design Pattern** is a **microservices transaction management pattern** used to maintain **data consistency** across **multiple services** in a **distributed system**, **without using distributed transactions (2PC)**.

---

## 🔁 **What is the Saga Pattern?**

A **Saga** is a **sequence of local transactions** where each service performs a transaction and **publishes an event** or **calls the next service**.
If one transaction fails, the saga triggers **compensating transactions** to undo the previous operations.

---

## 🔧 **Why Sagas?**

* In microservices, you can't use a **single ACID transaction** across services.
* Sagas provide **eventual consistency** by chaining local transactions and rollback logic.

---

## ✅ **Types of Saga Patterns**

### 1. **Choreography (Event-Driven)**

No central coordinator. Each service listens to events and reacts accordingly.

#### 🔸 Example:

1. **Order Service** creates an order → publishes `OrderCreated`
2. **Payment Service** consumes `OrderCreated`, processes payment → publishes `PaymentSuccessful`
3. **Inventory Service** consumes `PaymentSuccessful`, reduces stock → publishes `InventoryUpdated`
4. If **any step fails**, corresponding service publishes a failure event → compensating actions triggered by previous services

#### ✅ Pros:

* No single point of failure
* Loosely coupled

#### ❌ Cons:

* Hard to track and debug
* Complex logic scattered across services

---

### 2. **Orchestration (Central Coordinator)**

A central **Saga Orchestrator** controls the sequence of calls and compensations.

#### 🔸 Example:

1. **Orchestrator** calls Order → success
2. Calls Payment → fails
3. Calls compensating Order cancel method

#### ✅ Pros:

* Centralized flow logic
* Easier to monitor

#### ❌ Cons:

* Orchestrator can become a bottleneck
* Tightly couples orchestration logic

## 🔄 **Compensating Transactions**

* If a service operation fails, previously completed steps are **undone via compensating transactions**.
* For example, if **payment fails**, the **order should be canceled**, and **inventory released**.

## 📦 **Example: Order Processing Saga**

| Step | Service           | Action          | Compensating Action |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 1    | Order Service     | Create Order    | Cancel Order        |
| 2    | Payment Service   | Process Payment | Refund Payment      |
| 3    | Inventory Service | Reserve Stock   | Release Stock       |

---

## 🛠️ **Implementation in Spring Boot**

* **Choreography**: Use **Spring Cloud Stream**, **Kafka**, or **RabbitMQ**
* **Orchestration**: Implement a saga orchestrator using **Camunda**, **Axon**, or **Temporal.io**
